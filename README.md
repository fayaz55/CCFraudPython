***Credit Card Fraud Python***

## Intro 

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning (logistic regression) to predict whether a certain transaction is considered to be fraud or not. The dataset used is highly unbalanced as only 492 out of 284,807 transactions are classified as fraud. This dataset consists of 28 normalized features, along with Time and Amount. 

This notebook is run on the conda environment(Python 3.8.5).

The dataset is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
